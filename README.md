# Scala

Scala is a special language, since it is high level, but it runs on a JVM virtual machine, which comes from Java. And comparing it with this one, we can use the benefits that Java offers, but structured in a more friendly language. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, allowing modular, effective, and easily modelable development from the real world. This makes it a convenient option to develop an application with GUI graphical interface. Where the MVC can be used as a parameter to structure an application, breaking it down into three parts. The first part that allows data modeling. The second part that controls the use of this data and the view, which is in charge of the graphical interface. Each of these parts in turn contains classes that model an object.
